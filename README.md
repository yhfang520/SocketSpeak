Socket Speak is a chat room consisting of a server and multiple clients. The server is responsible for the client connections, accepting messages from one client, and sending the messages to all attached clients. Clients can open a socket to communicate with the server and the user may either send a message that is public
in the chat room, or that goes directly to a single, specified client. This program also includes the feature to generate and send a randomly generated sentence.   

### Get Start

- invoke `main` in `ChatServer`
```
[port]

```

- when run or build, make sure working directory is on /Assignment6, and json file is on working directory, so json file can be accessed.
